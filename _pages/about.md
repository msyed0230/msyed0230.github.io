This website is dedicated to the late Murshid Miyan, who worked diligently all his life to promote the teachings of Mahdi-e-Maud (AHS).

We hope that this website can serve as a hub for the global Mahdavia community and provide open access to some of the most important works on the virtues of Mahdavia culture.
